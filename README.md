## Key Takeaways

/ During the previous exercise, I couldn't understand how the methods work and was trying to work myself around it with whatever I can do. Now that I've started with this exercise, it turns out it's not as difficult as I was expecting it to be. I now understand the get and post methods (differences and their requests and response). This made me realize that separating the files made me understand the breakdown of the server. 

/ Most are built-in codes which helped me more to understand the use of them in navigating the server better. (acknowledge/deletedCount/deleteOne/deleteMany/updateOne/find)

/ Most of the references are from the demo during the discussion earlier, which made the exercise at least manageable.
